# Rolling Slots Module

## Overview
The name of this repo does a horrible name in descbribing the task this pallet is meant to do. But I thought it was a funny word play.

That said, this pallet aims to automate the lease allocation on a serie of given slots. So a more proper name would have been _rolling paras_ ? Anyway, the idea is to maintain two different groups of slots, long term and short term so the paras opting for these slots can receive leases on a rate defined depending on the type of the slot.
